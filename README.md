**WinGaze** is a **rerun and PyQt5 based application** for aligning multimodal signals, csv export, analysis, and visualization in Human Robot Interaction experiments.  
It integrates timeline annotations with synchronized video playback, performs real time MediaPipe-based pose tracking, and provides real-time plots and video panels in Rerun.
